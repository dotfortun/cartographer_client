# Notes

Added yarn and drawing canvas to mess around with that.

TODO:

- Web Frontend:
  - Player interface
  - Cards
  - Card n-ominos, templates
  - Objectives
- Desktop Frontend (probably in electron because reasons):
  - Game Loop
  - Displaying game state for players
- Backend:
  - DB models
  - Rules validation
  - Game state communication between host and clients via flask api

Notes:

- Jackbox-like clone of the board game Cartographers.
- Game host streams desktop client to players, who connect via website to game clients.
